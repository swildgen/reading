<p><i> &quot;The Dao is the hearth and home <br/> of the ten thousand things. <br/></i></p>

<p> &#8212; Laozi, #62 <br/></p>
<p><b> Abstract <br/></b></p>
<p> Web3 today centers around expressing transferable, &#0;nancialized assets, rather than encoding social <br/> relationships of trust.  Yet many core economic activities&#8212;such as uncollateralized lending and <br/> building personal brands&#8212;are built on persistent, non-transferable relationships.  In this paper, we <br/> illustrate how non-transferable &#8220;soulbound&#8221; tokens (SBTs) representing the commitments, <br/> credentials, and a&#0;liations of &#8220;Souls&#8221; can encode the trust networks of the real economy to establish <br/> provenance and reputation.  More importantly, SBTs enable other applications of increasing <br/> ambition, such as community wallet recovery, sybil-resistant governance, mechanisms for <br/> decentralization, and novel markets with decomposable, shared rights.  We call this richer, pluralistic <br/> ecosystem &#8220;Decentralized Society&#8221; (DeSoc)&#8212;a co-determined sociality, where Souls and <br/> communities come together bottom-up, as emergent properties of each other to co-create plural <br/> network goods and intelligences, at a range of scales.  Key to this sociality is decomposable property <br/> rights and enhanced governance mechanisms&#8212;such as quadratic funding discounted by correlation <br/> scores&#8212;that reward trust and cooperation while protecting networks from capture, extraction, and <br/> domination.  With such augmented sociality, web3 can eschew today&#8217;s hyper-&#0;nancialization in favor <br/> of a more transformative, pluralist future of increasing returns across social distance. <br/></p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p><b> &#167;1   INTRODUCTION <br/></b></p>
<p> Web3 has stunned the world by forging a parallel system of &#0;nance of unprecedented &#0;exibility and <br/> creativity in less than a decade.  Cryptographic and economic primitives such as public key cryptography, <br/> smart contracts, proof of work, and proof of stake have led to a sophisticated and open ecosystem for <br/> expressing &#0;nancial transactions. <br/></p>
<p> Yet the economic value &#0;nance trades on is generated by humans and their relationships.  Because <br/> web3 lacks primitives to represent such social identity, it has become fundamentally dependent on the very <br/> centralized web2 structures it aims to transcend, replicating their limitations. <br/></p>
<p> Examples of these dependencies include: <br/></p>
<p> 1.  Most NFT artists rely on centralized platforms like OpenSea and Twitter to commit to <br/> scarcity and initial <b> provenance </b>. <br/></p>
<p> 2.  DAOs that try to move beyond simple coin-voting often rely on web2 infrastructure, such <br/> as social media pro&#0;les, for <b> sybil resistance </b>. <br/></p>
<p> 3.  Many web3 participants rely on custodial wallets managed by centralized entities like <br/> Coinbase or Binance.  Decentralized <b> key management </b> systems are not user-friendly for any <br/> but the most sophisticated. <br/></p>
<p> Furthermore, the lack a native web3 identity makes today&#8217;s DeFi ecosystem unable to support <br/> activities ubiquitous in the real economy, such as <b> undercollateralized lending </b> or simple contracts,  like an <br/><b> apartment lease </b>.  In this paper, we illustrate how  even small and incremental steps towards representing <br/> social identity with soulbound tokens could overcome these limitations and bring the ecosystem far closer to <br/> regenerating markets with their underpinning human relationships in a native web3 context. <br/></p>
<p> Even more promising, we highlight how native web3 social identity, with rich social <i> composability </i>, <br/> could yield great progress on broader long-standing problems in web3 around wealth concentration and <br/> vulnerability of governance to  &#0;nancial attacks ,  while spurring a Cambrian explosion of innovative political, <br/> economic, and social applications.  We refer to these use cases and the richer pluralistic ecosystem that they <br/> enable as <b> &#8220;Decentralized Society&#8221; (DeSoc) </b>. <br/></p>
<p><b> &#167;2   OUTLINE <br/></b></p>
<p> We begin by explaining the primitives of DeSoc, centered around accounts (or wallets) holding <br/><b> non-transferable (initially public) &#8220;soulbound&#8221; tokens (SBTs) </b> representing commitments, credentials, <br/> and a&#0;liations.  Such tokens would be like an extended resume, issued by other wallets that attest to these <br/> social relations. <br/></p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> We then describe a &#8220;stairway&#8221; of increasingly ambitious applications across the social stack such <br/> primitives could empower, including: <br/></p>
<p> &#9679;  establishing provenance <br/> &#9679;  unlocking undercollateralized lending markets through reputation <br/> &#9679;  enabling decentralized key management <br/> &#9679;  thwarting and compensating for coordinated strategic behavior <br/> &#9679;  measuring decentralization <br/> &#9679;  creating novel markets with decomposable, shared rights and permissions <br/></p>
<p> This description culminates with a vision of DeSoc&#8212;a co-determined sociality, where Souls and <br/> communities come together bottom-up, as emergent properties of each other to co-create plural network <br/> goods, including plural intelligences, at a range of social scales. <br/></p>
<p> Finally, we answer several potential concerns and objections, and make comparisons to other <br/> identity paradigms familiar in the web3 space, conceding often how our vision is just a &#0;rst step but <br/> nonetheless an advance in programmable privacy and communication.  Then, we consider technical <br/> pathways to bootstrap the vision we imagine.  Building o&#0; these, we look forward, more philosophically, to <br/> the potential of DeSoc to redirect web3 to a more profound, legitimate, and transformative path. <br/></p>
<p><b> &#167;3   SOULS <br/></b></p>
<p> Our key primitive is accounts, or wallets, that hold <b><i> publicly visible </i>, <i> non-transferable </i> (but <br/> possibly <i> revocable </i>-by-the-issuer) tokens </b>.  5  We refer to the accounts as <b> &#8220;Souls&#8221; </b> and tokens held by the <br/> accounts as <b> &#8220; Soulbound Tokens&#8221;  (SBTs) </b>.  We initially assume publicity despite our deep interest in privacy <br/> because it is technically simpler to validate as a proof-of-concept, even if limited by the subset of tokens <br/> people are willing to publicly share.  Later in the paper, we introduce the concept of &#8220;programmable <br/> privacy&#8221; for richer use cases. <br/></p>
<p> Imagine a world where most participants have Souls that store SBTs corresponding to a series of <br/> a&#0;liations, memberships, and credentials.  For example, a person might have a Soul that stores SBTs <br/> representing educational credentials, employment history, or hashes of their writings or works of art.  In <br/> their simplest form, these SBTs can be &#8220;self-certi&#0;ed,&#8221; similar to how we share information about ourselves <br/> in our CVs.  But the true power of this mechanism emerges when SBTs held by one Soul can be issued&#8212;or <br/> attested&#8212;by other Souls, who are counterparties to these relationships.  These counterparty Souls could be <br/> individuals, companies, or institutions.  For example, the Ethereum Foundation could be a Soul that issues <br/> SBTs to Souls who attended a developer conference.  A university could be a Soul that issues SBTs to <br/></p>
<p> 5  We have chosen this set of properties not because they are clearly the most desirable collection of characteristics, but <br/> because they are easy to implement in the current environment and permit signi&#0;cant functionality.  We explore <br/> programmably private SBTs in Section 5.3. <br/></p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> graduates.  A stadium could be a Soul that issues SBTs to longtime Dodgers fans. <br/></p>
<p> Note there is no requirement for a Soul to be linked to a legal name, or for there to be <i> any <br/></i> protocol-level attempt to ensure &#8220;one Soul per human.&#8221;  A Soul could be a persistent pseudonym with a <br/> range of SBTs that cannot easily be linked.  6  We also do not assume non-transferability of Souls across <br/> humans.  Instead, we try to illustrate how these properties, where needed, can naturally emerge from the <br/> design itself. <br/></p>
<p><b> &#167;4   STAIRWAY TO DESOC <br/></b></p>
<p><b> 4.1   Art &amp; Soul <br/></b></p>
<p> Souls are a natural way for artists to stake their reputation on their works.  When issuing a tradeable <br/> NFT, an artist could issue the NFT from their Soul.  The more SBTs the artist&#8217;s Soul carries, the easier it <br/> would be for buyers to identify the Soul as belonging to that artist, and thereby also con&#0;rm the NFT&#8217;s <br/> legitimacy.  Artists could go a step further to issue a linked SBT stored in their Soul that attests to the NFT&#8217;s <br/> membership to a &#8220;collection&#8221; and vouches for whatever scarcity limits the artist wishes to set.  Souls would <br/> thus create a veri&#0;able, on-chain way to stake and build reputation on the provenance and scarcity of an <br/> object. <br/></p>
<p> Applications extend beyond art, to services, rentals, and any market built on scarcity, reputation, or <br/> authenticity.  An example of the latter is verifying the authenticity of purported factual recordings, such as <br/> photographs and videos.  With advances in deep fake technology, direct inspection by both humans and <br/> algorithms will increasingly fail to detect veracity.  While <b> blockchain inclusion enables us to trace the  time <br/> a particular work was made, SBTs would enable us to trace the <i> social provenance </i></b><i></i>, giving us rich social <br/> context to the Soul that issued the work&#8212;their constellation of memberships, a&#0;liations, credentials&#8212;and <br/> their social distance to the subject.  &#8220;Deep fakes&#8221; could be readily identi&#0;ed as those artifacts originated <br/> outside of time and social context, while trusted artifacts (like photographs) would emerge from the <br/> attestation of reputable photographers.  Whereas present technology de-contextualizes cultural products <br/> (like pictures) and opens them to unchecked, viral attacks lacking social context, SBTs can recontextualize <br/> such objects and empower Souls to take advantage of trust relationships already present within communities <br/> as a meaningful backstop to protect reputation. <br/></p>
<p><b> 4.2   Soul Lending <br/></b></p>
<p> Perhaps the largest &#0;nancial value built directly on reputation is credit and uncollateralized lending. <br/> Currently, the web3 ecosystem cannot replicate simple forms of uncollateralized lending, because all assets <br/></p>
<p> 6  Note, however, that in principle legal names could be represented themselves as SBTs: a family name would be a <br/> membership SBT to a family group and a given name could be a gifted SBT from parents to their child.  In fact, richer <br/> notions of names would be easy to represent if, for example, other family lines or relations gifted membership SBTs to a new <br/> child. <br/></p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> are transferable and saleable&#8212;thus simply forms of collateral.  The &#8220;traditional&#8221; &#0;nancial ecosystem <br/> supports many forms of uncollateralized lending, but relies on centralized credit scores to gauge <br/> creditworthiness of borrowers who have little incentive to share information about their credit history.  But <br/> such scores have many &#0;aws.  At best, they opaquely overweight and underweight factors relevant to <br/> creditworthiness, and bias those who haven&#8217;t  accumulated  su&#0;cient data &#8212;mainly minorities and the poor. <br/> At worst, they can enable <i> Black Mirror </i> opaque &#8220;social  credit&#8221; systems that engineer social outcomes and <br/> reinforce discriminations. <br/></p>
<p><b> An ecosystem of SBTs could unlock a censorship-resistant, bottom-up alternative to top-down <br/> commercial and &#8220;social&#8221; credit systems. </b> SBTs that  represent education credentials, work history, and <br/> rental contracts could serve as a persistent record of credit-relevant history, allowing Souls to stake <br/> meaningful reputation to avoid collateral requirements and secure a loan.  Loans and credit lines could be <br/> represented as non-transferable but revocable SBTs, so they are nested amongst a Soul&#8217;s other SBTs&#8212;a kind <br/> of non-seizable reputational collateral&#8212;until they are repaid and subsequently burned, or better yet, <br/> replaced with proof of repayment.  SBTs o&#0;er useful security properties: non-transferability prevents <br/> transferring or hiding outstanding loans, while a rich ecosystem of SBTs ensures that borrowers who try to <br/> escape their loans (perhaps by spinning up a fresh Soul) will lack SBTs to meaningfully stake their <br/> reputation. <br/></p>
<p> The ease of computing public liabilities with SBTs would open-source lending markets.  New <br/> correlations between SBTs and repayment risk would emerge, birthing better lending algorithms that <br/> predict creditworthiness and thereby reduce the role of centralized, opaque credit-scoring infrastructure. <br/> Better yet, lending would likely occur <i> within </i> social  connections.  In particular, SBTs would o&#0;er a substrate <br/> for community lending practices similar to those pioneered by Muhammad Yunus and the Grameen Bank, <br/> where members of a social network agree to support one another&#8217;s liabilities.  Because a Soul&#8217;s constellation <br/> of SBTs represents memberships across social groups, participants could easily discover other Souls who <br/> would be valuable co-participants in a group lending project.  Whereas commercial lending is a <br/> &#8220;lend-it-and-forget-it&#8221; until repayment model, community lending might take a &#8220;lend-it-and-help-it&#8221; <br/> approach&#8212;combining working capital with human capital with greater rates of return. <br/></p>
<p> How does uncollateralized community lending get o&#0; the ground?  At the start, we expect Souls to <br/> carry only SBTs that re&#0;ect information they are comfortable with sharing publicly, such as information in a <br/> CV.  While limited in scope, it might be a level of resolution su&#0;cient for intra-community lending <br/> experiments to take o&#0;, especially if the SBTs are issued by reputable institutions.  For example, a <br/> constellation of SBTs that show certain programming credentials, participation in several conferences, and <br/> work history might be su&#0;cient for a Soul to take a loan (or raise seed capital) for their venture.  Such <br/> credentials and social relationships already informally play an important, but opaque role in capital <br/> allocation like venture capital. <br/></p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p><b> 4.3   Not Losing Your Soul <br/></b></p>
<p> The non-transferability of key SBTs&#8212;such as one-time issued education credentials&#8212;raises an <br/> important question: how do you not lose your Soul?  Recovery methods today, like muti-sig recovery or <br/> mnemonics, have di&#0;erent tradeo&#0;s in mental overhead, ease of transacting, and security.  Social recovery  is <br/> an emerging alternative that relies on a person&#8217;s trusted relationships.  SBTs allow a similar, but broader <br/> paradigm: <b> community recovery, where the Soul is the  intersectional vote of its social network. <br/></b></p>
<p> Social recovery is a good starting point for security, but has several drawbacks in security and <br/> usability.  A user curates a set of &#8220;guardians'' and gives them the power, by majority, to change the keys of <br/> their wallet.  Guardians could be a mix of individuals, institutions, or other wallets.  The problem is a user <br/> must balance the desire for a reasonably high number of guardians against the precaution that guardians be <br/> from discrete social circles to avoid collusion.  Also, guardians can pass away, relationships sour, or people <br/> simply fall out of touch, requiring frequent and attention-taxing updates.  While social recovery avoids a <br/> single point of failure, successful recovery nonetheless depends on curating and maintaining trusted <br/> relationships with a majority of guardians. <br/></p>
<p><b> A more robust solution is to tie Soul recovery to a Soul&#8217;s memberships across communities, not <br/> curating but instead drawing on a maximally broad set of real-time relationships for security. </b> Recall <br/> that SBTs represent memberships to di&#0;erent communities.  Some of these communities&#8212;like employers, <br/> clubs, colleges, or churches&#8212;might be more o&#0;-chain in nature, while others&#8212;like participation in protocol <br/> governance or a DAO&#8212;might be more on-chain.  In a community recovery model, recovering a Soul&#8217;s <br/> private keys would require a member from a quali&#0;ed majority of a (random subset of) Soul&#8217;s communities <br/> to consent. <br/></p>
<p> Social recovery  SBT community recovery <br/></p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> Like social recovery, we assume that the Soul has access to secure, o&#0;-chain communications <br/> channels where &#8220;authentication&#8221;&#8212;through conversation, meeting in person, or con&#0;rming a shared <br/> secret&#8212;can occur.  Such communication channels would require greater bandwidth (technically the ability <br/> to carry richer &#8220;information entropy&#8221;) than, for example, on-chain bots or computation over SBTs <br/> themselves.  Indeed, we can think of SBTs as fundamentally being all about representing participation or <br/> access to such authentic&#8212;namely high bandwidth&#8212;communication channels. <br/></p>
<p> Precise details to make this work will require experimentation.  How guardians are chosen and how <br/> many guardians&#8217; consent is required, for example, are key security parameters for further research.  With <br/> such a rich information base, however, community recovery should be computationally possible, with <br/> security increasing as a Soul joins more distinct communities and forms more meaningful relationships. <br/></p>
<p> Community recovery, as a security mechanism, embodies the theory of  identity proposed by <br/> turn-of-the-20th-century sociologist Georg Simmel &#8212;founder  of social network theory&#8212;in which <br/> individuality emerges from the intersection of social groups, just as social groups emerge as the intersection <br/> of individuals.  Maintaining and recovering cryptographic possession of a Soul requires consent of the Soul&#8217;s <br/> network. <b> By embedding security in sociality </b>, a Soul  can always regenerate their keys through community <br/> recovery, which deters Soul theft (or sale): because a Seller would need to prove selling the recovery <br/> relationships, any attempt to sell a Soul lacks credibility. <br/></p>
<p><b> 4.4   Souldrops <br/></b></p>
<p> So far we have explained how Souls can come to represent individuals and re&#0;ect their unique traits <br/> and solidarities as they acquire SBTs that re&#0;ect their a&#0;liations, memberships, and credentials.  Such <br/> individuation helps Souls build reputations, establish provenance, access uncollateralized lending markets, <br/> and protect reputation and identity.  But the converse is also true; <b> SBTs also enable <i> communities </i> to be <br/> convened at unique intersections of Souls </b>.  Thus far  web3 has largely relied on token sales or airdrops to <br/> summon new communities, which yield little accuracy or precision.  Airdrops, in which tokens are <br/> algorithmically given for free to a set of wallets, mostly fall to some combination of existing token holders <br/> and wallets&#8212;easily attacked by sybils, encouraging strategic behavior and the  Matthew e&#0;ect .  SBTs  o&#0;er a <br/> radical improvement we call &#8220;souldrops.&#8221; <br/></p>
<p> &#8220;Souldrops&#8221; are airdrops based on computations over SBTs and other tokens within a Soul.  For <br/> example, a DAO that wants to convene a community within a particular layer 1 protocol could souldrop to <br/> developers who hold 3 out of the last 5 conference attendance SBTs, or other tokens re&#0;ecting attendance <br/> like POAPs.  Protocols could also programmatically weight token drops across a combination of SBTs.  We <br/> can imagine a non-pro&#0;t whose mission is to plant trees dropping governance tokens to Souls who hold a <br/> mix of environmental action SBTs, gardening SBTs, and carbon sequestration tokens&#8212;perhaps dropping <br/> more tokens to the carbon sequestration token-holders. <br/></p>
<p> Souldrops could also introduce novel incentives to encourage community engagement.  Dropped <br/></p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> SBTs could be engineered to be soulbound for a period but eventually &#8220;vest&#8221; into transferable tokens over <br/> time.  Or the reverse could be true.  Transferable tokens held for some period could unlock the right to SBTs <br/> that confer further governance rights over a protocol.  SBTs open a rich possibility space to experiment with <br/> mechanisms that maximize community engagement and other goals, like decentralization, which we discuss <br/> further below. <br/></p>
<p><b> 4.5   The DAO of Souls <br/></b></p>
<p> Distributed autonomous organizations (DAOs) are virtual communities that come together around <br/> a common purpose, coordinated by voting through smart contracts on a public blockchain.  While DAOs <br/> o&#0;er great potential for coordination of global communities across distance and di&#0;erence, they are <br/> vulnerable to sybil attacks where a single user can have multiple wallets to accrue voting power&#8212;or in less <br/> sophisticated one-token-one-vote style governance, simply hoard tokens to accrue 51% voting power and <br/> dispossess the other 49%. <br/></p>
<p> DAOs could mitigate sybil attacks with SBTs in several ways, by: <br/></p>
<p> &#9679;  computing over a Soul&#8217;s constellation of SBTs to <b> di&#0;erentiate  between unique Souls and <br/> probable bots </b>, and denying <i> any </i> voting power to a Soul  that appears to be a Sybil. <br/></p>
<p> &#9679; <b> conferring more voting power to Souls </b> who hold more  reputable SBTs&#8212;like work or <br/> educational credentials, licenses, or certi&#0;cations. <br/></p>
<p> &#9679;  issuing <b> specialized &#8220;proof-of-personhood&#8221; SBTs </b>, which  could help other DAOs bootstrap <br/> sybil resistance. <br/></p>
<p> &#9679; <b> checking for <i> correlations </i> between SBTs </b> held by Souls  who support a particular vote, and <br/> applying a lower vote weight to voters who are highly correlated. <br/></p>
<p> The latter idea of correlation checking is particularly promising and novel.  A vote supported by many Souls <br/> who all share the same SBT(s) is more likely to be a Sybil attack and&#8212;even if <i> not </i> a Sybil attack&#8212;such  a vote <br/> is more likely to be a group of Souls who are <i> making  the same error in judgment or who share the same bias </i>, <br/> and so should reasonably be weighted less than a vote with the same numerical level of support but from a <br/> more diverse base of participants.  7 <br/></p>
<p> We explore the latter idea mathematically in greater detail in the context of quadratic funding in the <br/></p>
<p> 7  See  https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1264948490834247681  and <br/> https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1265252184813420544  for informal Twitter poll evidence suggesting that <br/> people already &#0;nd the idea of taking diversity into account in decision-making mechanisms intuitive. <br/></p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> Appendix, where we introduce a new primitive, called the <b> &#8220;correlation score </b>.&#8221; This concept of correlation <br/> discounting could be extended to structure deliberative conversations.  For example, DAOs susceptible to <br/> majoritarian capture could compute over SBTs to bring maximally diverse members together in conversation <br/> and ensure minority voices are heard. <br/></p>
<p> DAOs could also rely on SBTs to deter forms of strategic behavior such as &#8220;vampire attacks.&#8221;  In <br/> such attacks, a DAO&#8212;typically with an associated DeFi protocol of economic value&#8212;free-rides o&#0; the R&amp;D <br/> of another by copying their open-source code and subsequently luring users&#8217; liquidity with a token.  DAOs <br/> could deter free-riders by &#0;rst creating a norm around souldropping (perhaps vesting SBTs) only to probable <br/> sybil-resistant Souls who delivered liquidity and then withholding souldrops to Souls who shifted their <br/> liquidity in a vampire attack.  The same mechanism wouldn&#8217;t work with airdrops to wallets because a holder <br/> can spread liquidity across many wallets to obfuscate their liquidity trail. <br/></p>
<p> DAOs could also use SBTs to make leadership and governance programmatically responsive to their <br/> communities.  Leadership roles could dynamically shift as the composition of the community shifts&#8212;as <br/> re&#0;ected in the changing distribution of SBTs across member Souls. A subset of members could be elevated <br/> to potential o&#0;cer roles based on their intersectionality and coverage across multiple communities within <br/> the DAO.  Protocols that value community cohesion could use SBTs to keep intersectional Souls at the <br/> center.  Alternatively, DAOs may opt for governance that elevates certain combinations of traits more than <br/> others, such as diversity among zip codes or participation among a subset of special hobby DAOs. <br/></p>
<p><b> 4.6   Measuring Decentralization through Pluralism <br/></b></p>
<p> When analyzing real-world ecosystems, it is desirable to measure how decentralized the ecosystem <br/> actually is.  To what extent is the ecosystem truly decentralized, and to what extent is the decentralization <br/> &#8220;fake&#8221; and the ecosystem de-facto dominated by one or a small set of coordinating entities? <br/></p>

<p><b> 4.7   Plural Property <br/></b></p>
<p> DAOs often own&#8212;or organize around owning&#8212;assets, both in the virtual and physical worlds.  So <br/> far web3&#8217;s scope has largely been limited to a narrow class of property whose bundle of rights are <i> wholly <br/> transferable </i>: tokens, NFTs, artworks, &#0;rst editions  or rare manuscripts like the U.S. Constitution.  But the <br/> emphasis on transferability has been to web3&#8217;s detriment, making it incapable of representing and <br/> supporting some of the simplest and ubiquitous property contracts today, such as apartment leases. <br/> Property rights are de&#0;ned in the Roman legal tradition as bundles of rights to use (&#8220;usus&#8221;), consume or <br/> destroy (&#8220;abusus&#8221;), and pro&#0;t (&#8220;fructus&#8221;).  Rarely are all these rights jointly vested in the same owner. <br/> Apartment leases, for example, confer limited rights of use (&#8220;usus&#8221;) to the lessor, but not unfettered rights to <br/> destroy the apartment (&#8220;abusus&#8221;), sell it o&#0; (&#8220;fructus&#8221;), or even transfer use (subletting).  Rights of real <br/> property (land) are typically encumbered by a range of restrictions on private use, grants of public rights of <br/> access, limits on rights of sale, and even rights of purchase by eminent domain.  They are also typically <br/> encumbered with mortgages that transfer some &#0;nancial value to lenders. <br/></p>
<p> The future of property innovation is unlikely to build on wholly transferable private property so far <br/> imagined web3.  Rather <b> innovation will hinge on the  ability to decompose property rights to match <br/> features of existing property regimes, and code even richer elaborations </b>.  Corporations and other <br/> organizational forms evolved precisely to recon&#0;gure property rights in even more creative ways&#8212;for <br/> example, granting employees access to proprietary facilities (&#8220;usus&#8221;), but reserving for managers rights to <br/> change or damage assets (&#8220;abusus&#8221;), while paying shareholders most &#0;nancial bene&#0;t (&#8220;fructus&#8221;).  SBTs have <br/> the &#0;exibility to represent and proliferate such nuanced property rights of both physical and virtual assets, <br/> while encouraging new experiments.  Here are just a few use cases: <br/></p>
<p> &#9679; <b> Permissioning access </b> to privately or publicly controlled  resources (e.g., homes, cars, <br/> museums, parks, and virtual equivalents). Transferable NFTs fail to capture this use case <br/> well because often access rights are conditional and non-transferable: if I trust you to enter <br/> my backyard and use it as recreational space, that does not imply that I trust you to <br/> sub-license that permission to someone else. <br/></p>
<p> &#9679; <b> Data Cooperatives </b> where SBTs grant data access to  researchers, while instantiating <br/> members&#8217; rights to grant access (perhaps by quadratic vote) and bargain for economic rights <br/> to discoveries and intellectual property born out of research.

<p> &#9679; <b> Experiments in participation </b> where SBTs create a continuous  basis for less contextualized <br/> Souls (e.g., immigrants, adolescents) to gain in&#0;uence within novel and broader networks. <br/> Such Souls would begin with narrow SBTs that pool them with their families or local <br/> communities.  As their a&#0;liations gradually diversify, they would gain broader SBTs that <br/> instantiate voting rights to in&#0;uence broader networks&#8212;in the spirit of Danielle Allen&#8217;s <br/> idea of  polypolitanism &#8212;a process that currently is  mediated by arbitrary age and residence <br/> cut-o&#0;s. <br/></p>
<p> &#9679; <b> Experiments in market design </b>, such as Harberger taxation  and SALSA (self-assessed <br/> licenses sold at auction), where holders of an asset post a self-assessed price at which anyone <br/> else can buy the asset from them, and must periodically pay a tax proportional to the <br/> self-assessed price to maintain control.  SBTs could be used to create more nuanced versions <br/> of SALSA&#8212;for example, where rights of participation are approved by the community to <br/> minimize strategic behavior from within or outside the community. <br/></p>
<p> &#9679; <b> Experiments in democratic mechanism design </b> such as  quadratic voting.  Holders of SBTs <br/> representing membership in a community could quadratically vote on parameters such as <br/> incentives and tax rates.  Ultimately, &#8220;markets&#8221; and &#8220;politics&#8221; are not separate design spaces; <br/> SBTs can be a major part of a technological stack that enables the entire space <i> between </i> the <br/> two categories to be explored.  Provision of public goods through quadratic funding is <br/> another such intersection. <br/></p>
<p> Of course, there are dystopian scenarios to consider.  Immigration systems could be permissioned <br/> with migratory SBTs.  Regulatory capture could be codi&#0;ed in nested community tokens, where <br/> homeowners have a disproportionate voting power and stall housing construction.  SBTs could automate <br/> red-lining.

Siberia). <br/> Similarly, <i> human motivation </i> is rarely fully sel&#0;sh  or fully altruistic; there are many patterns of pre-existing <br/> cooperation, and some more present among certain communities over others. <br/></p>
<p> Yet mechanism design today assumes atomized, sel&#0;sh agents without <i> pre-existing </i> cooperation, <br/> often making mechanisms vulnerable to innocent over-coordination,  8  at best, and intentional collusion, at <br/> worst, by groups who are <i> already </i> cooperative.  Thus,  even the best public funding models, including <br/> Quadratic Funding (QF), <i> can&#8217;t scale </i>.  QF encourages  coordination by o&#0;ering diminishing rewards to <br/> concentrated action of the few, but increasing rewards to collective action of the many; for example, a total <br/> of $1 contributed equally by 10 people is matched by $99 to generate $100 in total, while $10 contributed by <br/> a single person receives no match.  Mathematically, this is accomplished by matching funds proportional to <br/> the square of the sum of the square roots of individual contributions (as we further elaborate in the <br/> Appendix).  But even <i> weak cooperation </i> (say donating  $1 to a cause) among large groups (say most citizens of <br/> China) would dominate the system and absorb all its matching funds because the premium QF puts on the <br/> number of unique contributors.  As is, QF doesn&#8217;t discount coordination among correlated, special interests <br/> that may swamp a QF round, but instead <i> rewards </i> it. <br/></p>
<p> But rather than treating pre-existing cooperation as a bug we ought to &#8220;write over,&#8221; the key is to <br/> acknowledge it as re&#0;ecting partial cooperation that we should harness and compensate for.  Afterall, we are <br/> in the business of encouraging cooperation.  The trick is to make quadratic mechanisms work alongside <br/> pre-existing networks of cooperation, correcting for their biases and tendencies to over-coordinate.  SBTs <br/> o&#0;er a natural way by allowing us to tip the scales in favor of cooperation  across differences .  As Nobel <br/> Laureate Elinor Ostrom famously highlighted, the problem is less coordinating public goods <i> per se </i> but <br/> rather one of helping communities made up of imperfectly cooperative but socially connected individuals <br/><i> overcome </i> their social di&#0;erences to coordinate at  scale in broader networks. <br/></p>
<p> If SBTs represent community memberships that re&#0;ect a Soul&#8217;s partialities, <b> favoring cooperation <br/> across di&#0;erences simply means discounting cooperative rewards to similarly a&#0;liated or correlated <br/> Souls&#8212;similarity measured by their shared SBTs </b>.  The  assumption is that consensus <i> between the <br/> differently  a&#0;liated better signals plural goods  across  broader  networks, whereas consensus between  the <br/> similarly </i> a&#0;liated more likely signals over-coordinated  (or colluded) goods serving narrower interests. <br/></p>
<p> By revealing shared memberships across Souls, SBTs allow us to <i> discount </i> pre-existing cooperation <br/> and quadratically scale up plural  goods that confer  bene&#0;ts widely across emergent networks&#8212; <b>agreed upon <br/> by the most diverse members </b>&#8212;rather than more narrow  goods innocently over-coordinated (or <br/> intentionally colluded) by special interests.  The precise formula for correlation discounting  &#8220;optimally&#8221; <br/> depends on model details and has not yet been studied, but we provide a &#0;rst pass for experimentation for <br/> 8  We say &#8220;innocent,&#8221; because highly-cooperative groups naturally will seek to advance their interests, which may very well be <br/> for <i> their </i> collective bene&#0;t. <br/></p>

<p><b> &#167;5   PLURAL SENSEMAKING <br/></b></p>
<p> An example of plural network goods that are of increasing salience in a digital world are predictive <br/> models built o&#0; user data.  Both arti&#0;cial intelligence (AI) and prediction markets seek to predict future <br/> events based on data primarily elicited from people.  But both paradigms are limited in di&#0;erent and nearly <br/> opposite ways.  The dominant paradigm in AI eschews incentives, instead hoovering up (public or privately <br/> surveilled) data feeds and synthesizing them into predictions through proprietary large-scale, non-linear <br/> models&#8212;harnessing the default web2 monopoly on &#8220;usus&#8221; without any &#8220;fructus&#8221; &#0;owing to data laborers. <br/> Prediction markets take the opposite approach, where people bet on outcome in the hopes of &#0;nancial gains, <br/> relying entirely on economic incentives of &#0;nancial speculation (&#8220;fructus&#8221;) without synthesizing the beliefs <br/> of bettors to produce composable models.  At the same time, both of these paradigms yield conclusions that <br/> are characterized as &#8220;objective&#8221; truths; whereas AI models are portrayed as &#8220;universal&#8221; or &#8220;generally <br/> intelligent,&#8221; prediction markets are portrayed as summarizing all the beliefs of the market participants in a <br/> single number: equilibrium price. <br/></p>
<p> A more productive paradigm is to eschew these extremes, and instead draw on the virtues of both, <br/> while compensating for their weaknesses and enriching their breadth.  We propose thoughtfully combining <br/> the complexity of non-linear AI models with the market incentives of prediction markets to transform <br/> passive data laborers into active data creators. With such provenance-rich information rooted in the sociality <br/> of data creators, we illustrate how DeSoc can unlock plural network(ed) intelligence more powerful than <br/> either approach. <br/></p>
<p><b> 5.1   Prediction Markets to Prediction Plurality <br/></b></p>
<p> Prediction markets aim to aggregate beliefs based on wealth and risk preferences of those willing to <br/> bet&#8212;money talks.  But this &#8220;survival of the &#0;ttest&quot; isn&#8217;t a desirable way to aggregate beliefs.  A zero-sum <br/> game where one trader&#8217;s gain is another&#8217;s loss assumes a generalized ability at prediction that wrests with <br/> &#8220;the smart&#8221; and not &#8220;the dumb.&#8221;  While wealth may be a proxy for some forms of ability and expertise, <br/> predictions that account for other forms of relative expertise may be more reliable.  Participants who have <br/> lost bets in a particular domain, may have more accurate beliefs in another domain.  But prediction markets <br/> have the unfortunate e&#0;ect of eliciting beliefs of those prone to gambling, which enriches those who win <br/> bets, impoverishes the rest, and discourages general participation of the risk-averse. <br/></p>
<p> There are better ways to elicit beliefs.  Research  suggests that while prediction markets generally <br/> outperform simple polling, they don&#8217;t outperform <i> sophisticated  team prediction polling </i>, where people have <br/> incentives to share and discuss information.  Under team deliberation models, members can be weighted <br/> based on factors like past performance and peer evaluation, and the team participates in semi-structured <br/> discussions to pool information that can&#8217;t be encapsulated simply in a buy or sell contract.  Such t eam <br/> deliberation models can be further improved with <b> quadratic  rules to elicit exact probability estimates <br/></b></p>

<p> SBTs could unlock a new class of rich models and experiments in predictive power and relative <br/> expertise.  Whereas prediction markets elicit one  number&#8212;the price of a contract&#8212;quadratic polling elicits <br/> each participant&#8217;s <i> exact </i> belief about the probability  of an event. SBTs enable further <b> computation over <br/> those beliefs <i> in social context </i></b><i></i> of the education credentials,  memberships, and general sociality of a <br/> participant to develop better weighted (or non-linearly synthesized) predictive models, likely surfacing <br/> expert predictors at novel, unforeseen intersections.  So even if a poll did not aggregate beliefs well, polls <br/> could be studied retroactively to uncover the characteristics of &#8220;more correct&#8221; participants and convene <br/> better tailored &#8220;experts&#8221; in future polls, perhaps in a deliberative team context.  These mechanisms are <br/> closely related to those we advocate throughout this paper.  In the same way that quadratic mechanisms <br/> discounted by correlation scores can transform poorly coordinated top-down public goods into powerful, <br/> bottom-up plural network goods, they can also transform governance systems based on zero-sum prediction <br/> markets that incent participants to hide their information (e.g., Futarchy) into more positive-sum plural <br/> sense-making that can encourage revelation and synthesis of new and better information. <br/></p>
<p><b> 5.2   Arti&#0;cial Intelligence to Plural Intelligence <br/></b></p>
<p> Large scale  non-linear &#8220;neural network&#8221; models  (such  as BERT and GPT-3) could also be <br/> transformed by SBTs.  Such models hoover volumes of public or privately surveilled data feeds to produce <br/> rich models and predictions, such as  code based on  natural language prompts .  Most surveilled data creators <br/> aren&#8217;t aware of their role in creating these models, retain no residual rights, and are viewed as &#8220;incidental&#8221; <br/> rather than as key participants. Moreover, data hoovering divorces models from their social context, which <br/> masks their biases and limitations and undermines our ability to compensate for them.  These tensions have <br/> increasingly come to the fore with  growing demand  for data availability , new initiatives like &#8220; data  sheets for <br/> data sets &#8221; that document data provenance, and  privacy-preserving  approaches to machine learning . Such <br/> approaches require giving meaningful economic and governance stakes to those who generate the data and <br/> incenting them to cooperate in producing models more powerful than what they could build alone. <br/></p>

<p> 10  If an individual assesses probability p, their expected payo&#0; is pX and cost is X^2/2.  Taking the derivative with respect to <br/> X, the optimality condition is p=X, assuming risk neutrality, which is reasonable for small stakes (both the payo&#0; and the <br/> cost may be arbitrarily scaled down or up and the same argument holds). <br/></p>
<p> 9  Under a quadratic rule, team members can buy a contract  that pays out $X conditional on an event occurring, but costs <br/> $(X^2)/2.  For example, an individual who sets X=0.5 will receive $0.5 if the event occurs&#8212;paid by the poller&#8212;and will pay <br/> $0.125 regardless. <br/></p>

In particular, SBTs allow <br/> carefully and proportionately targeted incentives for data (and data quality) at individuals and communities <br/> based on their characteristics.  At the same time, model-makers can track the characteristics of the collected <br/> data and their social context&#8212;as re&#0;ected by SBTs&#8212;and &#0;nd contributors that o&#0;set biases and compensate <br/> for limits.  SBTs can also program bespoke governance rights to data creators, allowing them to form <br/> cooperatives that pool data and negotiate uses.  This bottom-up programmability by data creators enables a <br/> future of plural intelligences, where model-makers can compete to negotiate uses over the same data to build <br/> di&#0;erent models.  Thus, we move away from a paradigm of a detached monolithic &#8220;arti&#0;cial intelligence&#8221; <br/> free from human origins, hoovering up provenance-free surveilled data to instead a <b> Cambrian explosion of <br/> cooperatively constructed plural intelligences rooted in social provenance and governed by Souls </b>. <br/></p>
<p> Over time, just as SBTs individuate a Soul, they also come to individuate models&#8212;embedding data <br/> provenance, governance and economic rights directly into the model&#8217;s code. Thus, plural intelligences&#8212;like <br/> humans&#8212;build a Soul embedded in human sociality.  Or depending on how you look at it, humans evolve <br/> over time embedded in plural intelligences&#8212;each with a unique Soul, complementing and cooperating with <br/> other Souls.  And, in this, we see the convergence of the prediction market and AI paradigms towards plural <br/> sense-making, combining widely distributed incentives and careful tracking of social context to create a <br/> diversity of models that combine the best of both approaches into a technology paradigm more powerful <br/> than either. <br/></p>
<p><b> 5.3   Programmable Plural Privacy <br/></b></p>
<p> Plural intelligences raise important questions about data privacy.  Afterall, to build such powerful <br/> intelligences requires pooling data across individuals from large data sets (e.g., health data), or capturing data <br/> that isn&#8217;t interpersonal but shared (e.g., a social graph).  &#8220;Self-sovereign identity&#8221; advocates tend to treat data <br/> as private property: data about this interaction is <i> mine </i> and so <i> I </i> should be able to choose when and to  whom <br/> to reveal it.  However, even more than in the physical economy, the data economy is poorly understood in <br/> terms of simple private property.  In simple two-way relationships, such as an illicit a&#0;air, the right to reveal <br/> information is usually symmetrical, often requiring mutual-permission and consent.  As scholar Helen <br/> Nissenbaum highlights, the concern is not &#8220;privacy&#8221; as such but lack of integrity to  context in the sharing  of <br/> information .  The Cambridge Analytica scandal was  largely about people revealing properties of their social <br/> graph and information about their friends, without their consent. <br/></p>
<p> Rather than privacy-as-transferable-property-right, a more promising approach is to treat <b> privacy as <br/> a programmable, loosely coupled bundle of  rights to  permission access, alter or profit from <br/><i> information </i></b><i>. </i> Under such a paradigm, every SBT&#8212;such  as an SBT that represents a credential or access to a <br/> data store&#8212;would ideally also have an implied programmable property right <i> specifying access </i> to the <br/> underlying information constituting the SBT: the holders, the agreements between them, the shared <br/> property (e.g., data), and obligations to 3rd parties.  For example, some issuers would choose to make SBTs <br/> wholly public.  Some SBTs, such as a passport or health record, would be private in the self-sovereign sense, <br/></p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> with unilateral rights to disclose by Souls who carry the SBT.  Others, such as SBTs that re&#0;ect membership <br/> of a data cooperative, would have multi-signature or more sophisticated community voting permissions, <br/> where all or a quali&#0;ed majority of SBT holders must consent to disclosure. <br/></p>
<p> While there are current technical questions (can SBTs be programmed in such a way?) and <br/> important questions around incentive compatibility (explored further in Section 7)&#8212;we nonetheless think <br/> programmable plural privacy warrants further research and o&#0;ers key advantages over alternative paradigms. <br/> Under our approach, SBTs have the potential to enable privacy as a programmable, composable right that <br/> can map upon the complex set of expectations and agreements we have today. Moreover, such <br/> programmability could help us reimagine new con&#0;gurations, as there are an  infinite  number of ways <br/><b> privacy&#8212;as a <i> right to permission access to information&#8212; </i>could  be composed with &#8220;usus,&#8221; &#8220;abusus,&#8221; <br/> and &#8220;fructus&#8221; </b> to create a nuanced constellation of  access rights.  For example, SBTs could permission <br/> computations over data stores&#8212;perhaps owned and governed by a plurality of Souls&#8212;using a speci&#0;c <br/> privacy preserving technique.  Some SBTs may even permission access to data in a way where certain <br/> computations can be made, but the results cannot be <i> proven </i> to third parties.  A simple example is a vote:  the <br/> voting mechanism needs to tally votes from every Soul, but votes should not be provable to anyone else to <br/> prevent vote buying. <br/></p>
<p> Communication is perhaps the most canonical form of shared data.  Yet today&#8217;s communication <br/> channels lack both user control and governance (&#8220;usus&#8221; and &#8220;abusus&#8221;) and at the same time auction user <br/><i> attention </i> (&#8220;fructus&#8221;) to the highest bidder&#8212;even if  a bot.  SBTs have the potential to steward healthier <br/> forms of the &#8220;attention economy&#8221; that empowers Souls to spam-&#0;lter inbounds from likely bots outside of <br/> their social graph, while elevating communication from real communities and desired intersections. <br/> Listeners could become more aware of who they are listening to and better able to assign credit to works that <br/> spur insights.  Rather than optimizing for maximum engagement, such an economy could optimize for <br/> positive-sum collaborations and valuable co-creations.  Such communication channels also are important for <br/> security;  as noted above, &#8220;high bandwidth&#8221; communication channels are critical to building the security <br/> foundations of community recovery. <br/></p>
<p><b> &#167;6   DECENTRALIZED SOCIETY <br/></b></p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> social and economic relationships.  But simply building on trust and cooperation is not enough. Correcting <br/> for biases and tendencies to over-coordinate (or collude) among trust networks is essential to encouraging <br/> more intricate, diverse relationships that span greater social distances than before.  We call this <br/><b> &#8220;Decentralized Society (DeSoc)&#8221;: a co-determined sociality, where Souls and Communities convene <br/> bottom-up, as emergent properties of each other to produce <i> plural network goods </i> across di&#0;erent <br/> scales. <br/></b></p>
<p> We emphasize plural network goods as a feature of DeSoc, because networks are the most powerful <br/> engine of economic growth, yet the most susceptible to dystopian capture by private actors (e.g., web2) and <br/> powerful governments (e.g., Chinese Communist Party).  Most signi&#0;cant economic growth results from <br/><i> increasing network returns </i>, where every additional  unit of input yields incrementally <i> more </i> output. <br/> Examples of simple physical networks include roads, electrical grids, cities, and other forms of infrastructure <br/> built o&#0; labor and other capital inputs.  Examples of powerful digital networks include marketplaces, <br/> predictive models and plural intelligences built o&#0; data.  In both cases, network economics diverges from <br/> neoclassical economics, which teaches <i> decreasing </i> returns&#8212;where  every additional unit of input yields <br/> incrementally <i> less </i> output&#8212;and where private property  yields the most e&#0;cient outcomes.  Private property <br/> applied to an increasing returns context has the opposite e&#0;ect&#8212;throttling network growth by rent <br/> extraction.  A road between two cities can unlock increasing returns from gains from trade. But the same <br/> road privately owned can throttle growth if the owners choose to extract rent up to the value trading <br/> between the two cities.  Public ownership over a network also has its own perils, being susceptible to <br/> regulatory capture or underfunding. <br/></p>
<p><b> Networks with increasing returns are most e&#0;cient when treated neither as purely public nor <br/> purely private goods, but rather as <i> partial and plural  shared goods </i></b><i></i>.  DeSoc provides the social substrate <br/> to unbundle and recon&#0;gure rights&#8212;rights of use (&#8220;usus&#8221;), rights to consume or destroy (&#8220;abusus&#8221;), and <br/> rights of pro&#0;t (&#8220;fructus&#8221;)&#8212;and enable e&#0;cient governance mechanisms across these rights that augment <br/> trust and cooperation while checking for collusion and capture.  We&#8217;ve explored several mechanisms <br/> throughout this paper, such as community-based SALSA and quadratic funding (and voting) discounted by <br/> correlation scores.  This third way of partial and plural ownership avoids the Charybdis of private rent <br/> extraction and Scylla of public regulatory capture. <br/></p>
<p> In many ways, <b> DeFi today is a decreasing returns  private property paradigm retro&#0;tted onto <br/> increasing returns networks </b>.  Built on the premise  of <i> trustlessness </i>, DeFi is inherently limited to the  realm <br/> of wholly transferable private property (e.g., transferable tokens) that mostly bundles &#8220;usus,&#8221; &#8220;abusus,&#8221; and <br/> &#8220;fructus.&#8221;  At best, DeFi risks throttling network growth by rent extraction and at worst risks ushering in <br/> dystopian surveillance monopolies dominated  by &#8220;whales'' who harvest and hoover up data in a <br/> race-to-the-bottom&#8212;much like web2. <br/></p>
<p> DeSoc transforms DeFi&#8217;s race to control and speculate on the value of networks into a bottom-up <br/> coordination to build, participate, and govern them. At minimum, DeSoc&#8217;s social substrate can make DeFi <br/></p>

With <br/> DeSoc&#8217;s structural corrections, DeFi can support and expand plural networks that confer bene&#0;ts <br/> broadly&#8212;as agreed upon by the most diverse members&#8212;rather than further entrenching networks captured <br/> by narrow interests. <br/></p>
<p> Yet, the <b> greatest strength of DeSoc is its <i> network  composability </i>. </b> Sustained increasing returns <br/> and network growth isn&#8217;t simply avoiding the perils of rent extraction, but also encouraging the <br/> proliferation and intersection of nested networks.  A road may form a network between two cities. But cut <br/> o&#0; from broader cooperation, two cooperating cities will eventually hit a ceiling of diminishing <br/> returns&#8212;either because of <i> congestion </i> (roads and housing)  or <i> exhaustion </i> (reaching the limits of the people <br/> they can serve).  Only through technological innovation and growing broader, if looser, cooperation with <br/> neighboring networks for new sources of increasing returns can value continue to grow exponentially.  Some <br/> cooperation will be physical, incrementally extending physical trade across space.  But many more <br/> connections will be informational and digital.  Over time, we will see new matrices of cooperation between <br/> physical and digital networks, reliant upon and extending the social interconnections they are built on.  It is <br/> precisely this intersecting, partly nested structure of ever growing network cooperation across digital and <br/> physical worlds that DeSoc enables. <br/></p>
<p> Through composing networks and coordination, DeSoc emerges at the intersection of politics and <br/> markets&#8212;augmenting both with sociality.  DeSoc empowers the vision of JCR Licklider&#8212;founder of <br/> ARPANET that created the internet&#8212;of &#8220;man-computer symbiosis&#8221; in an &#8220;intergalactic computer <br/> network&#8221; with dramatically increased social dynamism <i> built on trust </i>.  Rather than build on DeFi&#8217;s <i> trustless <br/></i> premise, DeSoc encodes trust networks that underpin the real economy today and enables us to harness <br/> them to generate plural network goods resilient to capture, extraction, or domination.  With such <br/> augmented sociality, web3 can eschew short-term hyper-&#0;nancialization in favor of an unbounded future of <br/> increasing returns across social distance. <br/></p>
<p><b> 6.1   Souls can go to Heaven&#8230;or Hell <br/></b></p>
<p> While we have selectively highlighted the potential unlocked by DeSoc that we &#0;nd promising, it is <br/> important to remember that almost any technology with such transformative potential will have a similar <br/> potential for destructive transformation: &#0;re burns; the wheel steamrolls; the television brainwashes; cars <br/> pollute; credit cards trap in debt, and so on.  Here, the same SBTs that could be used to compensate for <br/> in-group dynamics and achieve cooperation across di&#0;erences could also be used to automate red-lining of <br/> disfavored social groups or even target them for cyber or physical attack, enforce restrictive migration <br/> policies, or make predatory loans.  Many of these possibilities are less salient in the current web3 ecosystem <br/> because they aren&#8217;t meaningful concepts given the current substrate.  Enabling upsides of DeSoc also enables <br/> these harms.  Just as the downside of having a heart is that a heart can be broken, the downside of having a <br/> Soul is it can go to hell and the downside of having a society is that societies are often animated by hatred, <br/></p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> prejudice, violence and fear. Humanity is a great and often tragic experiment. <br/></p>
<p> As we meditate on the possible dystopias of DeSoc, we should also contextualize these possibilities <br/> within other technological enabled dystopias.  Web2 is architecture for opaque authoritarian surveillance <br/> and social control.  Whereas web2 often relies on top-down arti&#0;cial bureaucracies to confer identity (a <br/> &#8220;driver&#8217;s license&#8221;), DeSoc relies on horizontal (&#8220;peer-to-peer&#8221;) social attestations.  Whereas DeSoc empowers <br/> Souls to encode their own relationships and co-create plural property, web2 intermediates social connections <br/> or monetizes them with opaque algorithms that can polarize, divide, and misinform.  DeSoc sidesteps <br/> top-down, opaque social credit systems.  Web2 forms the basis of them.  DeSoc treats Souls as agents, <br/> whereas web2 treats Souls as objects. <br/></p>
<p> The risk of social control with DeFi&#8212;without any identity substrate&#8212;is less, at least in the <br/> near-term.  But DeFi has its own dystopia. <b> While  DeFi overcomes <i> explicit </i> forms of <br/> centralization&#8212;where speci&#0;c actors have an outsized level of formal power within a system&#8212;it has <br/> no built-in way to overcome <i> implicit </i> centralization  through collusion and market power </b>.  Monopolies <br/> don&#8217;t always surface as the Standard Oils of the past.  Collusion can even happen at higher and far-removed <br/> levels of an ecosystem.  We see this today with the rise of a class of institutional asset managers (e.g., <br/> Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street, Fidelity, etc.) that are the largest shareholders of all the largest banks, <br/> airlines, car companies, and other major industries. Because such asset managers hold a stake across all rivals <br/> within an industry (i.e. a stake in every major airline), their incentive is to make the companies that they hold <br/><i> look </i> like a competing industry but <i> act </i> like a monopolist  that maximizes industry-wide pro&#0;ts and <br/> entrenchment at consumer and general-public expense.  11 <br/></p>
<p> In DeFi too, the same &#8220;whales&#8221; and VCs accumulate larger shares across each level of the stack and <br/> across competitors within a stack, perhaps voting in token governance, or delegating it to the same class of <br/> delegates, who are also similarly correlated across the network.  Without any social substrate for <br/> sybil-resistance and correlation discounts to force-function decentralization, we should also expect to see <br/> more monopolies funded by whales, as monopolists increasingly become the largest pool of available <br/> investment capital.  As &#8220;the money class&#8221; and users diverge, we should expect to see (and already see) greater <br/> and greater levels of incentive misalignment and rent extraction.  If DeFi applications that deal with private <br/> data emerge, we may well see similar dynamics, such as apps encourage bidding wars between multiple <br/> people who &#8220;own&#8221; data that is actually interpersonal (e.g., their social graph) to build monolithic private AIs <br/> that compete against humans, eschewing a future of competing plural AIs that augment humans. <br/></p>
<p> Thus, DeSoc does not need to be perfect to pass the test of being acceptably non-dystopian; to be a <br/> paradigm worth exploring it merely needs to be better than the available alternatives.  Whereas DeSoc has <br/><i> possible </i> dystopian scenarios to guard against, web2  and existing DeFi are falling into patterns that are <br/><i> inevitably </i> dystopian, concentrating power among an elite who decide social outcomes or own most of the <br/> 11  See Posner, E. &amp; Weyl, E.

The direction of web2 is deterministically authoritarian, accelerating the capacity of top-down <br/> surveillance and behavior manipulation.  The direction of today&#8217;s DeFi is nominally anarcho-capitalist, but <br/> is already falling into network e&#0;ect and monopoly pressures that risk its medium-term path becoming <br/> authoritarian in much the same way. <br/></p>
<p> DeSoc, in contrast, is <b> stochastic social pluralism </b>&#8212;a  network of individuals and communities that <br/> come together, as emergent properties of each other, co-determining their own future.  Looking at web2, the <br/> outgrowth of DeSoc can be analogized to the rise of popular participatory governments out of centuries of <br/> monarchy.  Participatory governments didn&#8217;t <i> inevitably </i> give rise to democracy; it also led to the rise of <br/> communism and fascism.  Similarly, SBTs don&#8217;t make digital infrastructure <i> inherently </i> democratic, but  are <br/> democratic-compatible depending on what Souls and communities co-determine.  Opening this possibility <br/> space is a marked improvement over web2&#8217;s authoritarianism and DeFi&#8217;s anarcho-capitalism. <br/></p>
<p><b> &#167;7   IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES <br/></b></p>
<p> Privacy presents a key challenge for DeSoc. On the one hand, too many public SBTs may reveal too <br/> much information about a Soul, making them vulnerable to social control.  On the other hand, too many <br/> purely private SBTs may also lead to private communication channels that eschew correlation discounting <br/> for governance and social coordination&#8212;presenting important incentive compatibility questions.  Closely <br/> related to the issue of privacy is the issue of cheating: Souls may misrepresent their social solidarities, while <br/> coordinating through private or side channels.  We cannot aspire to know all the possibilities and answers, <br/> but instead explore the nature of the challenge here and sketch a few promising paths for future research. <br/></p>
<p><b> 7.1   Private Souls <br/></b></p>
<p> Blockchain-based systems are public by default.  Any relationship that is recorded on-chain is <br/> immediately visible not just to the participants, but also to anyone in the entire world.  Some privacy can be <br/> retained by having multiple pseudonyms: a family Soul, a medical Soul, a professional Soul, a political Soul <br/> each carrying di&#0;erent SBTs.  But done naively, it could be very easy to correlate these Souls to each other. <br/> The consequences of this lack of privacy are serious.  Indeed, <b> without explicit measures taken to protect <br/> privacy, the &#8220;naive&#8221; vision of simply putting all SBTs on-chain may well make too much information <br/> public for many applications </b>. <br/></p>
<p> To deal with over-publicity, there are a number of solutions with di&#0;erent levels of technical <br/> complexity and functionality.  The simplest approach is that an SBT could store data o&#0;-chain, leaving only <br/> the hash of the data on-chain. <br/></p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> On-chain data (fully public)  O&#0;-chain data, on-chain hash link (Owner chooses <br/> when to reveal) <br/></p>
<p> The choice of how to store the o&#0;-chain data is left to the person; possible solutions include (i) their own <br/> devices, (ii) a cloud service trusted by them, or (iii) decentralized networks such as the Interplanetary File <br/> System (IPFS).  Storing data o&#0;-chain lets us continue to have smart contracts that permission the right to <br/><i> write </i> SBT data, but at the same time have separate  permissions to <i> read </i> that data.  Bob can choose to  reveal <br/> the contents of any of his SBTs (or the data stores which they permission) only when he wishes to.  This <br/> already gets us quite far, and has the further bene&#0;t of improving technical scalability because most data <br/> only needs to be handled by a very small number of parties.  But to fully achieve properties like plural <br/> privacy, as well as more &#0;ne-grained forms of disclosure, we need to go further.  Fortunately, many <br/> cryptographic technologies let us do that. <br/></p>
<p> One powerful set of building blocks that enables new ways to partially reveal data is a branch of <br/> cryptography called &#8220; zero knowledge proofs .&#8221;  While  zero knowledge proofs are most frequently used today <br/> to enable privacy-preserving transfers of assets, they also can allow people to prove arbitrary statements <br/> without revealing any more information beyond the statement itself.  For example, in a world where <br/> government documents and other attestations are cryptographically provable, someone could prove a <br/> statement like &#8220;I am a citizen of Canada, who is over 18 years old and has a university degree in economics <br/> and over 50,000 Twitter followers, and who has not yet claimed an account in this system.&#8221; <br/></p>
<p> 21 <br/></p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p><b> Zero-knowledge proofs </b> can be computed over SBTs to  prove characteristics about a Soul (e.g., that <br/> it has certain memberships).  This technique can be extended further by introducing <b> multi-party <br/> computation </b> techniques such as  garbled circuits , which  could make such tests <i> doubly private </i>: the prover <br/> does not reveal who they are to the veri&#0;er, and the veri&#0;er does not reveal their veri&#0;cation mechanism to <br/> the prover.  Instead, both parties make the computation together and only learn the output. <br/></p>
<p> Another powerful technique is  designated-verifier  proofs .  In general, &#8220;data&#8221; is slippery: if I send  a <br/> movie to you, I cannot technologically prevent you from recording and sending it to a third party. <br/> Workarounds like Digital Rights Management (DRM) have at best limited e&#0;ectiveness, and often come at <br/> great costs to users. Proofs, however, are not slippery in the same way.  If Amma wants to prove some <br/> property X about her SBTs to Bob, she can make a zero knowledge proof of the statement &#8220;I hold SBTs that <br/> satisfy property X, OR I have the access key to Bob&#8217;s Soul.&#8221;  Bob would &#0;nd this statement convincing: he <br/> knows that he did not make the proof, and so Amma must actually have SBTs that satisfy property X.  But if <br/> Bob passes the proof along to Cuifen, Cuifen would not be convinced: for all he knows, Bob could have <br/> made the proof with his own key.  This can be made even stronger with  verifiable delay functions (VDFs) : <br/> Amma can make and present a proof that can only be made with the required SBTs right now, but anyone <br/> else will be able to make  five minutes from now .  This means it is possible to represent sophisticated <br/><b> access permissions to <i> trustworthy proofs about  data </i> despite the impossibility of making the same <br/> kinds of selective permissions to the raw data itself, which may simply be copy and pasted </b>.   This may <br/> take us quite far nonetheless.  Just as blockchains o&#0;er traceability in transactions that prevents someone <br/> from right-click copy-and-pasting a valuable NFT (and sybil attacking the original owner), similarly SBTs <br/> can o&#0;er traceability in social prevenance, which at minimum can reduce the value of copy-and-pasted data <br/> with unveri&#0;ed origins. <br/></p>
<p> These o&#0;-chain data and zero-knowledge techniques are compatible with <b><i> negative <br/></i> reputation </b>&#8212;SBTs that are made visible even if the  holder does not <i> want </i> them to be visible.  Important <br/> examples of negative reputation include credit history, data about unpaid loans, negative reviews and <br/> complaints from business partners, and SBTs attesting to social connections relevant for coordination. <br/> Blockchains coupled with the same cryptography could o&#0;er a potential solution: Souls could be forced by <br/> smart contract logic to incorporate negative SBTs into a data structure like a  Merkle tree  that is stored <br/> o&#0;-chain, and any zero knowledge proof or garbled circuit computation would require them to introduce <br/> that information, because otherwise there would be a visible &#8220;hole&#8221; in the provided data that the veri&#0;er <br/> would recognize.  The  Unirep protocol  is an example  of how this might be implemented. <br/></p>
<p> The point of these examples is not to show exactly how cryptographic technology can be used to <br/> solve all of the privacy and data permissioning problems with SBTs.  Rather, it is to sketch out a few <br/> examples to show the power of such technologies.  An important future research direction is to scope the <br/> exact limits of di&#0;erent kinds of data permissioning and the speci&#0;c combinations of techniques that work <br/></p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> best to achieve the desired level of permissions.  Another question is what types of plural property regimes <br/> are desirable to govern data, and how to properly unbundle access (&#8220;usus&#8221;), editing (&#8220;abusus&#8221;) and cash &#0;ow <br/> (&#8220;fructus&#8221;) rights. <br/></p>
<p><b> 7.2   Cheating Souls <br/></b></p>
<p> If SBTs are the social substrate upon which plural property, network goods and intelligences are <br/> coordinated, one might be concerned that Souls will try to trick or cheat their way into communities to gain <br/> access to governance or property rights that we imagine SBTs permissioning.  For example, if many <br/> applications depend on SBTs representing conference attendance, unscrupulous conferences could o&#0;er such <br/> SBTs in exchange for bribes.  With enough bribes, humans (and bots) could generate a fake social graph that <br/> makes the account look like an authentic human Soul, richly di&#0;erentiated by (fake) SBTs.  Just as  DAOs  can <br/> be bribed , so can Souls and the on-chain voting mechanisms  which they use.  Conversely, if SBTs are used to <br/> discount coordination, Souls may avoid SBTs to maximize their in&#0;uence.  Why should we believe that the <br/> SBTs a Soul possess accurately re&#0;ect their true social commitments rather than simply how they choose to <br/> play this game? <br/></p>
<p> One argument is that the varying incentives to cheat may &#8220;balance out.&#8221;  Souls may sort and <br/> self-identify into the networks that are important to them at the right scale, much like how Harberger taxes <br/> balance out the incentive to over-value and under-value assets to elicit approximately accurate market <br/> valuations.  Souls will want to hold more SBTs to gain in&#0;uence within their communities, but on the other <br/> hand will eschew SBTs from communities they care less about to score lower on correlation metrics and <br/> increase their in&#0;uence in governance over broader networks. <br/></p>
<p> But it would be naive to assume that the two incentives&#8212;to gain access and maximize <br/> in&#0;uence&#8212;always evenly cancel out, or even come close to canceling out, as though by magic.  There may be <br/> many communities that use systems other than SBTs to gate access and governance.  Or communities <br/> may&#8212;counter to our primary assumption about publicity&#8212;dole out private SBTs to re&#0;ect governance <br/> rights, but induce community members to keep these SBTs secret in broader decisions. <br/></p>
<p><b> The problem of &#8220;gaming&#8221; should not be understated. It is a signi&#0;cant issue and resolving it is <br/> one of the most important foci for future research </b>.  Indeed, it is a major reason why open-sourcing many <br/> existing algorithms that prioritize or &#0;lter for human users is very challenging.  To mitigate and deter SBT <br/> gaming, we suggest several norms and cryptographic directions: <br/></p>
<p> 1.  The ecosystem of SBTs could <b> bootstrap o&#0; &#8220;thick&#8221;  community channels </b>, where SBTs signal <br/> authentic o&#0;-chain community membership with strong social bonds and repeat interactions.  This <br/> would make it easier for communities to &#0;lter and revoke SBTs of impersonators and bots.  Such <br/> thick channels&#8212;which we often &#0;nd in churches, workplaces, schools, meet-up groups, and <br/> organizations in civil society&#8212;would provide a more sybil-resistant social substrate to police gaming <br/></p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> (e.g., through bots, bribes, impersonation) in more &#8220;thin&#8221; social channels. <br/></p>
<p> 2. <b> Nested communities could require SBTs to force context on potential collusion vectors &#8220;just <br/> below&#8221; them </b>.  For example, if a state were holding  a funding round or vote, the state might require <br/> every participating citizen to also hold an SBT of a de&#0;ned county and municipality. <br/></p>
<p> 3.  The openness and cryptographic provability of the SBT ecosystem could itself be used to <b> actively <br/> detect collusive patterns and penalize inauthentic behavior </b>&#8212;perhaps discounting the voting <br/> power of collusive Souls, or obliging Souls to accept SBTs representing negative attestations.  For <br/> example, if one Soul attests to the humanity of another Soul that turns out to be a bot, the case can <br/> be escalated and publicly veri&#0;ed, leading to that Soul having a large number of negative <br/> attestations.  This already happens to an extent within the GitCoin QF ecosystem, where a range of <br/> signals are used to detect &#8220;collusive groups.&#8221; <br/></p>
<p> 4.  ZK technology (eg.  MACI ) could <b> cryptographically prevent  some attestations made by a Soul <br/> from being provable </b>.  This would make attempts to  sell certain kinds of attestations non-credible, <br/> because the briber would have no way to tell whether or not the bribe recipient followed through on <br/> their side of the deal.  There has been  a large body  of research  on the use of such techniques for <br/> voting, but ultimately  any non-&#0;nancialized social  mechanism  may end up bene&#0;ting from similar <br/> ideas. <br/></p>
<p> 5.  We could <b> encourage whistleblowers </b> as a way of making  collusion of signi&#0;cant size unstable. <br/> Instead of detecting and penalizing incorrect or abusive <i> behavior </i>, we detect and penalize abusive <br/><i> patterns of collusion </i>.  This technique is risky to  overuse because of the possibility of false-&#0;ag bribes, <br/> but it is nevertheless part of the toolkit. <br/></p>
<p> 6.  We could use <b> mechanisms from  peer-prediction theory </b> to encourage reporting to be honest in all <br/> cases except where collusion is extremely large.  Instead of the conference attesting to attendees&#8217; <br/> attendance, attendees could attest to <i> each other&#8217;s </i> attendance, so the number of participants that <br/> would need to be bribed to attest to a false claim becomes very large.  The rewards need not be <br/> &#0;nancial, but could be SBTs, making the rewards more useful to genuine community members than <br/> they are to attackers. <br/></p>
<p> 7.  We could use correlation scores that <b> focus on correlations  where there is a large incentive to be <br/> honest </b> if a group of Souls share a common interest.  For example, the correlation scoring technique <br/> used in  bounded pairwise quadrating funding  uses quadratic  funding donations themselves to <br/> determine how correlated two participants are, and therefore how much to discount their <br/> intersection.  If two participants share many common interests, their incentive to express this fact to <br/> the QF mechanism is certainly diminished with correlation discounting, but it never becomes <i> zero <br/></i> or <i> negative </i>. <br/></p>

<p> While the range of identity frameworks proposed is almost limitless, there are four particularly <br/> prominent and adjacent paradigms widely discussed in the web3 space that merit comparison:  the dominant <br/> &#8220;legacy&#8221; identity ecosystem, the pseudonymous economy, proof of personhood, and veri&#0;able credentials. <br/> Each paradigm highlights important contributions and challenges for future development of the social <br/> identity paradigm we advocate, and we use such limitations as a springboard for exploring future directions. <br/> All that considered, we also explain why we believe our social identity primitives of Souls and soulbound <br/> tokens are a more promising path forward for privacy regimes. <br/></p>
<p><b> 8.1   Legacy <br/></b></p>
<p> Legacy identity systems rely on pieces of papers or identity cards issued and mediated by a 3rd party <br/> (a government, university, employer, etc).  Provenance is established by calling up the 3rd party for a <br/> con&#0;rmation.  While the legacy system has an interesting set of properties we should understand more <br/> deeply, such systems are wildly ine&#0;cient and do not lend themselves to composability or computation for <br/> rapid, e&#0;cient coordination.  Moreover, these systems lack social context and makes Souls reliant on a <br/> centralized 3rd party to con&#0;rm membership to a community, rather than the embedding community.  For <br/> example, most government issued IDs eventually trace back to a birth certi&#0;cate issued on the authority of a <br/> medical doctor and family members, who are the ultimate source of truth and leave out many equally <br/> meaningful social connections that&#8212;taken together&#8212;o&#0;er far stronger validation.  In fact, when centers of <br/> concentrated power seek strong identi&#0;cation (e.g., getting a security clearance from a major government) <br/> they rarely rely on such documents, instead turning to interviews in social networks. <b> Thus such legacy <br/> identity systems tend to concentrate power in the issuer and in those who can undertake the due <br/> diligence to get stronger veri&#0;cation, who in turn become calci&#0;ed and unreliable bureaucracies </b>.  A <br/> crucial design goal of DeSoc is ensuring that the security requirements of government IDs can be met and <br/> exceeded, allowing horizontal networks to make greater security available to all users and through a range of <br/> social substrates. <br/></p>
<p><b> 8.2   Pseudonymous Economy <br/></b></p>
<p> The vision of a society based around combining reputation systems with zero knowledge proof <br/> mechanisms to preserve privacy has been most widely promoted by  Balaji Srinivasan , who coined and <br/> popularized the phrase &#8220;pseudonymous economy.&#8221;  His early version emphasizes the use of pseudonyms to <br/> avoid discrimination and evade &#8220;cancel culture&#8221; by social mobs that seek to harm a person&#8217;s reputation and <br/> break their social ties.  It envisions people accumulating <i> transferable </i> zero-knowledge (ZK) attestations in <br/> their wallets and evading reputational attacks by transferring a subset of attestations to new wallets, or <br/> splitting the attestations amongst multiple wallets, presumably without traceability.  In culling attestations <br/> to port, a person chooses the level of desired pseudonymity in the new account, weighing a tradeo&#0; between <br/> more anonymity (porting fewer attestations) or more distribution to their social network (porting over more <br/></p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> attestations). <br/></p>
<p> The practical di&#0;erence between typical pseudonymous economy proposals and DeSoc is that we <br/> deemphasize identity separation as a primary way to protect participants from abuses and cancel culture. <br/> Some level of separation (e.g., di&#0;erent Souls between family, work, politics, etc.) may be healthy, but in <br/> general there are great disadvantages to relying on the ability to spin up new identities as a primary crutch <br/> against attacks.  It makes reputation-staking for lending and provenance harder, and it composes poorly <br/> with governance mechanisms that try to correct for correlations or Sybils. <br/></p>
<p> Rather than protecting victims by allowing them to re-emerge from attacks with a new&#8211;if <br/> diminished&#8212;identity, DeSoc would allow other approaches, such as <b> contextualizing the attacker. <br/></b> &#8220;Cancellation&#8221; often arises precisely because statements and actions are taken <i> out of context </i> and viral signals <br/> travel through uncontextualized networks, when a person or bot has little social connection or context to a <br/> victim.  In the same way that SBTs provide provenance to protect against deep fakes, a map of SBTs socially <br/> graphs a &#8220;hit piece&#8217;s&#8221; origin.  &#8220;Hit pieces&#8221; essentially are artifacts arising outside of the victim&#8217;s communities <br/> (as re&#0;ected by shared SBT memberships),  or lacking SBT attestations from the victim&#8217;s <br/> communities&#8212;which should cast doubt on the piece&#8217;s veracity.  SBTs also empower victims to launch a <br/> defensive response to counteract the hit, curated and propagated from <i> their </i> network of trust (represented <br/> here by the patterns of co-holding of SBTs).  By maintaining social context, people can maintain trust, even <br/> if they are under threat of cancellation, and hold attackers accountable.  Improving provenance improves the <br/> social foundation of truth. <br/></p>
<p><b> 8.3   Proof of personhood (PoP) <br/></b></p>
<p> Proof of Personhood protocols (PoP) aim to provide tokens of individual uniqueness, to prevent <br/> Sybil attacks and allow non-&#0;nancialized applications.  To do so, they rely on approaches such as  global <br/> analysis of social graphs ,  biometrics ,  simultaneous  global key parties , or  some combination  thereof. <br/> However, because PoP protocols seek to represent <i> individual </i> identities&#8212;-focused on achieving <i> global <br/> uniqueness </i>&#8212;rather than <i> social identities </i> mapping relationships  and solidarities, <b> PoP protocols are limited <br/> to applications that treat all humans the same </b>.  Most  applications we are interested in&#8212;such as staking <br/> reputation&#8212;are relational and move beyond being a unique human to being a  differentiated  human. <br/></p>
<p> Moreover, PoP protocols are not immune to sybil attacks.  In almost all near-term foreseeable <br/> applications, PoP systems are e&#0;ectively open to Sybil attacks, just at a slightly higher cost.  Unless most <br/> people on the planet are registered for a PoP service and are participating in a particular validation exercise, <br/> an attacker can always recruit disinterested humans who are not yet participating to act as Sybils.  While <br/> such mercenaries are not quite bots, the di&#0;erence is super&#0;cial other than perhaps a small added expense. <br/></p>
<p> Many PoP protocols aim to build a substrate for universal basic income or global democracy.  While <br/></p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> we don&#8217;t share the same ambition, such protocols have spurred us to nonetheless consider how to build <br/> gradually towards coordinating plural network goods.  In contrast to the binary, individualist and global <br/> nature of PoP, our approach aims to construct a rich, contextual and layered substrate for bottom-up <br/> reputation, property and governance that allows participation in a range of communities and networks, <br/> small and large. <br/></p>
<p><b> 8.4   Veri&#0;able credentials <br/></b></p>
<p> Veri&#0;able credentials (VCs) are a W3C standard where credentials (or attestations) are zk-shareable <br/> at the holder&#8217;s discretion.  VCs highlight the major limitations of our baseline privacy paradigm and <br/> motivate our discussion of privacy extensions above. Until SBTs have privacy extensions that narrow <br/> publicity, VCs and SBTs can be seen as natural complements: in particular, SBTs are initially public making <br/> them inappropriate for sensitive information like government-issued identi&#0;cation, while VC <br/> implementations have struggled with a recovery paradigm that could be addressed by community recovery. <br/> The two approaches combined can in the near-term be stronger than either alone.  But VCs also have a key <br/> limitation: at least in their standardized form, VCs do not support most of the applications we have <br/> enumerated because of their <i> unilateral </i> privacy. <br/></p>
<p> Unilateral zk-sharing isn&#8217;t incentive-compatible with our use cases, nor does it re&#0;ect our norms <br/> around privacy.  Most of our applications depend on some level of publicity.  But under zk-sharing, Souls <br/> can&#8217;t know another Soul possesses an SBT unless it is shared to them&#8212;making reputation-staking, credible <br/> commitments, sybil-resistant governance, and simple rental contracts (e.g., apartment lease) impossible to get <br/> o&#0; the ground as other commitments and encumbrances are not necessarily visible.  More deeply, we are <br/> skeptical that unilateral shareability is usually the right privacy paradigm.  Rarely does one party in a <br/> multi-party relationship have the unilateral rights to disclose the relationship without the consent of the <br/> other.  Just as unilaterally transferable private property is not a rich property regime, simplistic unilateral <br/> shareability is not a very rich privacy regime.  If two parties co-own an asset and choose to represent their <br/> relationship through a VC, such credential doesn&#8217;t allow for the mutual-consent and mutual-permissions. <br/> This problem travels to more complex cases of plural property and complex organizational forms and <br/> permissions, which are a feature of DeSoc. <br/></p>
<p><b> &#167;9   SOUL BIRTH <br/></b></p>
<p> The path from the current web3 ecosystem to augmented sociality mediated by SBTs faces a classic <br/> cold start challenge.  On the one hand, SBTs are not transferable.  On the other hand, today's mix of wallets <br/> may not be the &#0;nal home for SBTs because they lack community recovery mechanisms.  But in order for <br/> community recovery wallets to work, they need a rich variety of SBTs across discrete communities to be <br/> secure. <b> What comes &#0;rst: SBTs or community recovery? </b> Who are the early adopter communities?  How <br/> do SBTs on di&#0;erent chains interoperate?  We cannot aspire to know all the possibilities and answers, but <br/></p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> instead sketch a few promising paths for the reader to further explore within the current web3 and even <br/> web2 architecture. <br/></p>
<p><b> 9.1   Proto SBTs <br/></b></p>
<p> Although the hallmark of SBTs is non-transferability, SBTs may also have another property which <br/> may prove more useful in bootstrapping: <i> revocability. </i> It&#8217;s possible that SBTs &#0;rst gestate as revocable, <br/> transferable tokens, before growing into non-transferability.  A token is revocable if an issuer can burn the <br/> token and re-issue it to a new wallet.  Burning and re-issuing would make sense when, for example, keys are <br/> lost or compromised, and the issuer has an interest in ensuring the tokens are not &#0;nancialized and sold o&#0; <br/> to a party&#8212;in other words, when the token signals authentic community membership.  Employers, <br/> churches, meet-up groups, clubs with repeat o&#0;-chain interactions are well positioned to burn and re-issue <br/> tokens because they have a relationship with a person, and can easily check for impersonation by phone call, <br/> video-conference, or simple meeting in person.  Single interactions, such as attendance to a concert or <br/> conference are poorly suited because community bonds are weaker. <br/></p>
<p><b> Revocable, transferable tokens are a kind of proto-SBT&#8212;serving supportive, placental <br/> functions before Soul birth </b>.  These tokens buy time  both for wallets to gestate secure, community recovery <br/> mechanisms and for a person to su&#0;ciently accumulate proto-SBTs that can eventually be burned and <br/> re-issued into non-transferable SBTs.  Under this pathway, the question is not, &#8220;what happens &#0;rst: SBTs or <br/> community recovery?&#8221; Rather, SBTs and community recovery instantiate simultaneously, birthing a Soul. <br/></p>
<p><b> 9.2   Community Recovery Wallets <br/></b></p>
<p> Although today&#8217;s wallets lack community recovery, they each have relative strengths and weaknesses <br/> in being homes&#8212;or perhaps gestational wombs&#8212;for SBTs.  Proof of Personhood (PoP) protocols have the <br/> advantage of already experimenting with social dispute resolution mechanisms, which are the foundation of <br/> community recovery.  Also, many DAOs use PoPs to facilitate governance, making them natural &#0;rst issuers <br/> of SBTs.  However, despite PoPs natural lead, PoP protocols haven&#8217;t yet earned broad trust to house valuable <br/> token assets, whereas custodial wallets have. <br/></p>
<p> Custodial wallets&#8212;despite their &#0;aws of centralization&#8212;may thus o&#0;er a natural onramp for less <br/> sophisticated retail users.  Such custodial wallets could also build tooling for retail communities to issue <br/> revocable tokens that later convert (or burn and reissue) into SBTs or even tooling for more &#8220;corporate&#8221; <br/> issuers&#8212;many of whom are looking for ways to build loyal customer bases in web3 but lack expertise in <br/> custody.  Once community recovery mechanisms have been formalized and battle-tested, these custodial <br/> wallets could decentralize into community recovery, while custodians move on to providing other valuable <br/> services in DeSoc (like community management, SBTs issuances, etc.) <br/></p>
<p> For more sophisticated web3 users, decentralized non-custodial wallets (or non-custodial social <br/> recovery wallets like Argent and Loopring) are a natural starting point for bootstrapping community <br/></p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> recovery mechanisms.  Non-custodial wallets have the advantage of being native web3 open-source, and the <br/> &#0;exibility to pre-announce and experiment with mechanisms incrementally to a subset of voluntary, <br/> sophisticated users to battletest incentives and mix mechanisms (e.g.,mult-sig).  All of these <br/> approaches&#8212;PoPs, custodial, and non-custodial&#8212;play an important role in experimenting and onboarding <br/> users with di&#0;erent degrees of sophistication and risk tolerance. <br/></p>
<p><b> 9.3   Proto-Souls <br/></b></p>
<p> Norms can also shepherd Souls into existence.  As we rethink tokens and wallets, we can also <br/> reframe how we think about certain classes of NFTs and tokens that are intended to signal membership.  In <br/> particular, we can introduce a norm of not transferring NFTs and POAPs issued by reputable institutions <br/> that re&#0;ect attendance to a conference, work experience, or education credentials.  Such transfers of <br/> membership tokens&#8212;if traded for value&#8212;could diminish the reputation of a wallet and perhaps discourage <br/> issuers from further issuing membership or POAP tokens to that wallet.  Already in the non-custodial <br/> ecosystem, a signi&#0;cant number of users have achieved signi&#0;cant &#0;nancial reputation and stake in their <br/> wallets, which could bootstrap as e&#0;ective collateral for them not to abuse non-transferability expectations. <br/></p>
<p> While all these pathways have respective challenges, we hope that the variety of approaches increases <br/> the chance of convergence to our quasi-equilibrium state in the medium term through a small set of steps. <br/></p>
<p><b> &#167;10   CONCLUSION <br/></b></p>
<p> As ambitious as we have been in imagining what DeSoc could enable, in many ways the above are <br/> just &#0;rst steps.  There is more than one road to DeSoc, including a number of non-blockchain based <br/> frameworks, such as  Spritely ,  ACDC  and  Backchannel  that rely on data stores tied to local machines rather <br/> than global ledgers.  These frameworks may eventually o&#0;er even greater trust across social distance, because <br/> they can harness transitivity of trust relationships&#8212;like trusted introductions&#8212;rather than relying on SBTs <br/> issued by well-known, high-status institutions (like universities or DAOs).  Furthermore the applications we <br/> describe above are just the beginning of what DeSoc can empower, not touching virtual worlds: their <br/> physics, society, and their complex intersection with the physical world.  All this suggests that even the broad <br/> ambitions we paint above are just the beginning of what DeSoc may eventually become. <br/></p>
<p> On that path, however, many challenges and open questions remain.  The above sketches require <br/> extensive red teaming and many of them are more suggestive than fully prescriptive.  How can DAOs <br/> maintain their publicity of state while thoughtfully comparing patterns of Souls and correlations in SBTs to <br/> enforce Sybil protections and decentralization?  How incentive compatible is acquiring SBTs in face of <br/> various schemes of correlation discounting?  How much does privacy con&#0;ict with correlation discounting <br/> and other DeSoc mechanism designs?  How can we measure inequality in a social and yet appropriately <br/> private (contextually integral) manner?  How should inheritance work in the community recovery <br/> framework?  Are there red lines that can be drawn or even baked into protocols to avoid dystopian scenarios? <br/> Or should we simply race to build the best scenarios &#0;rst?  These questions are just the beginning of what we <br/></p>

Albert Einstein told the 1932 disarmament <br/> conference that the failures of the &#8220;organizing power of man&#8221; to keep pace with &#8220;his technical advances&#8221; had <br/> put a &#8220;razor in the hands of a 3-year-old child.&#8221;  In a world where his observation seems more prescient than <br/> ever, learning how to program futures that encode <i> sociality </i>&#8212;rather than writing over trust&#8212;seems a <br/> required course for human life on this planet to persist. <br/></p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p><b> APPENDIX <br/></b></p>
<p><b> Adjusting Quadratic Mechanisms for Pre-Existing Cooperation <br/></b></p>
<p> Because quadratic mechanisms incent collaboration from a baseline of sel&#0;shness, they are <br/> vulnerable to groups who are <i> already </i> cooperative.  If SBTs re&#0;ect community memberships that individuate <br/> a Soul to re&#0;ect their partialities, SBTs can help us discount pre-existing cooperation and tip the scales in <br/> favor of cooperation  across differences .  Here we  provide an illustration of a &#0;rst attempt at a re&#0;ned <br/> quadratic model and o&#0;er future directions for research.  This mechanism is not optimized and doubtless <br/> has vulnerabilities; it is meant as an illustrative example to spur experimentation and future research.  While <br/> we illustrate with Quadratic Funding (QF), the same principles and formulas also apply to Quadratic Voting <br/> (where individual contributions are simply substituted with voice credits). <br/></p>
<p> In QF, a community matches individual contributions to shared projects with funds in proportion <br/> to the  square of the sum of the square roots of individual  contributions.  For &#0;xed contribution levels, <br/> matching funds grow as the square of the number of individual contributors, but have diminishing returns <br/> to individual contributions.  There are diminishing returns to concentrated individual action, but increasing <br/> returns to collective action.  For example, if Abdu,  Shou and Belle were non-cooperating <br/> individuals&#8212;contributing respectively  ,  and  currency units&#8212;the matching funds to their donations  in  &#55349;&#56372;  &#55349;&#56390;  &#55349;&#56373; <br/> a QF program (for example,  Gitcoin Grants ) should  be proportional (with scaling determined by available <br/> funds) to the  square of the sum of the square roots  of individual donations. <br/></p>
<p> &#55349;&#56390;&#55349;&#56406;&#55349;&#56410;&#55349;&#56413;&#55349;&#56409;&#55349;&#56402;  &#55349;&#56384;&#55349;&#56398;&#55349;&#56417;&#55349;&#56400;&#8462;  ~   &#55349;&#56372; +  &#55349;&#56390; +  &#55349;&#56373; ( ) 2 <br/>&#8722;  &#55349;&#56372; +  &#55349;&#56390; +  &#55349;&#56373; ( )<br/></p>
<p><b> Single Membership <br/></b></p>
<p> Now suppose a simpli&#0;ed model where Abdu, Shou and Belle are di&#0;erentiated by a single <br/> membership&#8212;workplace&#8212;and matching funds are available for startups, companies, and open-source <br/> projects (again, in the spirit of Gitcoin).  Because people from the same workplace have a strong incentive to <br/> contribute to their own workplace to maximize matching funds to their company, we should expect them to <br/> coordinate.  An extreme approach would be to assume that workers fully share goals and fully coordinate <br/> their behavior.  Yet even in this simple case, there are several ways we might compensate in the formula. <br/></p>
<p><b> A simple approach, which we call &#8220;clustering,&#8221; would put two co-workers &#8220;under the same <br/> square root&#8221; in the quadratic formula to o&#0;set their tendency to already coordinate. </b> If  Abdu and Shou <br/> were co-workers (but not Belle), Abdu and Shou&#8217;s contribution would be summed and square rooted <br/> together while Bob&#8217;s contribution would be square rooted alone, e&#0;ectively giving his contribution more <br/></p>

<p> &#55349;&#56374;&#55349;&#56409;&#55349;&#56418;&#55349;&#56416;&#55349;&#56417;&#55349;&#56402;&#55349;&#56415;  &#55349;&#56384;&#55349;&#56398;&#55349;&#56417;&#55349;&#56400;&#8462;  ~   &#55349;&#56372; +  &#55349;&#56390; +  &#55349;&#56373; ( ) 2 <br/>&#8722;  &#55349;&#56372; &#8722;  &#55349;&#56390; &#8722;  &#55349;&#56373; <br/></p>
<p> If Abdu and Shou are perfectly coordinated, it&#8217;s always optimal for them to split their join contribution <br/> equally, so we can assume  , letting us simplify:  &#55349;&#56372;  =   &#55349;&#56390;<br/></p>
<p>=  2 &#55349;&#56372; +  &#55349;&#56373; ( ) 2 <br/>&#8722;  2 &#55349;&#56372; +  &#55349;&#56373; ( )<br/></p>
<p> In this case, it is easy to see how clustering leads to optimality (or welfare maximization) by the same <br/> argument as for QF more generally: if Abdu and Shou are perfectly coordinated, they e&#0;ectively act as a <br/> single agent and the Clustering Matching formula is the QF formula for two agents&#8212;the joint Abdu-Shou <br/> agent and the Belle agent. <br/></p>
<p> Another adjustment that also achieves optimality is what we call the &#8220;O&#0;setting Match:&#8221; <br/></p>
<p> &#55349;&#56386;&#55349;&#56403;&#55349;&#56403;&#55349;&#56416;&#55349;&#56402;&#55349;&#56417;  &#55349;&#56384;&#55349;&#56398;&#55349;&#56417;&#55349;&#56400;&#8462;  ~   &#55349;&#56372; +  &#55349;&#56390; <br/> 2 <br/></p>

<p><b> The rationale in the O&#0;setting Match is that because Abdu and Shou are part of a perfectly <br/> coordinating size-2 group, we can reduce the weight of their votes by a factor of  to compensate  for </b> 2 <br/><b> the coordination. </b> This leads to the same outcome  as the Cluster Match as it is always optimal for a <br/> perfectly coordinated Abdu and Shou (  ) to make  equal contributions and in this case &#55349;&#56372; =  &#55349;&#56390;<br/></p>
<p> &#55349;&#56386;&#55349;&#56403;&#55349;&#56403;&#55349;&#56416;&#55349;&#56402;&#55349;&#56417;  &#55349;&#56384;&#55349;&#56398;&#55349;&#56417;&#55349;&#56400;&#8462;  ~   &#55349;&#56372; +  &#55349;&#56372; <br/> 2 <br/></p>
<p>+  &#55349;&#56373; ( ) 2 <br/>&#8722;  &#55349;&#56372; &#8722;  &#55349;&#56372; &#8722;  &#55349;&#56373; <br/></p>

<p><b> Multiple Memberships <br/></b></p>
<p> The previous example assumes Abdu, Shou and Belle have a single membership: workplace.  Yet in <br/> almost all applications this would be a vast oversimpli&#0;cation.  People have multiple community <br/> memberships, cooperative relationships, and even informal intersections.  Abdu and Belle might be extended <br/> family, Shou and Belle might have attended the same school, or Shou and Abdu might be token-holders of <br/> the same layer 1 protocol, and so on.  To facilitate cooperation across di&#0;erences, these correlations in <br/> memberships between individuals need to be recognized in a less binary manner.  We now consider <br/></p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p> extending each of the approaches above to do this.  We again focus on the simplest example su&#0;cient to <br/> make the point; below we follow up with more general formulae. <br/></p>
<p> We focus on an example where Abdu and Shou share an a&#0;liation, Abdu and Belle share a di&#0;erent <br/> a&#0;liation, and Shou has an a&#0;liation with a group that includes other members, but none participating in <br/> this matching round.  This is the complete set of a&#0;liations. <br/></p>
<p> To extend the Cluster Match to this case, we include a cluster for each group of shared a&#0;liations <br/> and distribute the contributions of each individual among all of the groups they participate in equally with <br/> coe&#0;cients on their contributions that sum to one. <br/></p>

<p> To extend the O&#0;set Match, we have to solve for coe&#0;cients on each individual&#8217;s contribution to <br/> compensate for the coordination bene&#0;ting that individual.  In particular, if we assume that Belle half <br/> internalizes Abdu&#8217;s value, that Abdu half internalizes Belle and a quarter internalizes Shou&#8217;s and Shou <br/> quarter internalizes Abdu&#8217;s, then we need to &#0;nd coe&#0;cients solving <br/></p>

<p> One appealing feature of this solution is that it will generally lead to optimality assuming that <br/> solidarity correctly measures e&#0;ective internalization of utility.  A less appealing feature is that it seems <br/> unlikely to be particularly &#8220;robust:&#8221; in particular and in contrast to other cases, it will not always be optimal <br/> for any individual to give all her contributions through the match rather than externally, given the penalties. <br/></p>
<p><b> Pairwise Matching <br/></b></p>
<p> A third mechanism, which we call &#8220;Pairwise Matching,&#8221; suggested by  Buterin (2019)  takes a <br/> di&#0;erent approach.  Pairwise Matching has the disadvantage that it does not achieve optimality but instead <br/> focuses on bounding losses from speci&#0;c attacks, but it has the important advantage that it does not require <br/> an extrinsic source to specify who is coordinating and who is not; instead, this information is extracted from <br/> the contribution values themselves. <br/></p>

<p> Note that Pairwise Matching does <i> not </i> achieve optimality:  colluding actors still have the incentive to <br/> somewhat over-report how much they value certain projects, and can even extract some funds by <br/> contributing to a fake project controlled by themselves.  Rather, this approach is intended to be a <br/> second-best, optimized for the case where limited outside information is available about which actors are <br/> actually colluding. <br/></p>
<p><b> That said, Pairwise Matching can be used as a <i> philosophical  template </i> for how to  account for <br/> pre-existing coordination without over-penalizing it </b>: instead of the correlation score only including <br/></p>
<p> values for that particular quadratic  funding system, it could attempt to include similar terms  &#55349;&#56421; <br/> &#55349;&#56372; &#8594; &#55349;&#56387; <br/></p>
<p> &#55349;&#56421; <br/> &#55349;&#56373; &#8594; &#55349;&#56387; <br/></p>
<p> for all instances where those two actors gained a bene&#0;t by cooperating.  If bene&#0;ts from cooperation are <br/> valued correctly, cooperating further would never be net-harmful for any pair of agents; rather, the net gains <br/> from further cooperation would simply approach zero. <br/></p>
